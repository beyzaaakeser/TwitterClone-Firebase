<h1>My Twitter Clone Firebase Project</h1>

This clone project, which recreates the main features of Twitter, provides a reliable user authentication and management infrastructure based on Firebase. In the project, users can easily log in using alternative login methods such as email/password or Google using Firebase Authentication. They can edit their profiles, profile photos, and information; this data is managed securely via Firebase.
Users can tweet only text, only photos, or both text and photos. Tweets can be edited or deleted by the user, thus providing personal content management.
There are comments and favorite (like) features for each tweet. Other users can comment on tweets and add favorites, and these interaction numbers are displayed instantly for each tweet.
All important actions made by users (logging in, tweeting, etc.) are instantly notified using React Toastify, which provides a more dynamic user experience.
Moment.js made users' tweet dates and times more understandable, thus making it easier to follow chronologically past tweets.
